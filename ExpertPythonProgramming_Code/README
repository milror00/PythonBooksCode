# Python Expert Programming code examples package

This is package with code examples for Python Expert Programming
(2nd edition) book.


## Structure of this package

Content of this package is divided into directories that refer exactly to
book chapters. Code may differ sligthly from snippets presented in book.
Sometimes it contains additional utilities, functions, or comments, that
are intended to improve readability. This should help you better understand
topics discussed in the book.

Each chapter directory contains `NOTES` file that explains the order in
which scripts should be executed or additional information about its
structure.

## How to use this package

In order to use code examples it is recommended to use virtual environments
as explained in Chapter 1, "Current Status of Python" of the book.

In short create new environment somwhere on you disk. Make sure you are using
at least Python 3.5 version to create virtual environment

    $ python3.5 -m venv book-env

Sometimes book covers topic of compatibility issues between Python 2 and
Python 3. If you want to run scripts in older versions of Python, use
`virtualenv` tool to create additional environment on your disk. Make sure to
name it differently so it will be clear which environment you are using in
given shell session:

    $ virtualenv -p python2.7 book-py27-env

If your environment is already created you are ready to activate it so all
installed packages will be isolated from your base system Python environment.
If you are using bash execute following line:

    $ source book-env/bin/activate

If you are working in Windows command line or Power Shell then type:

    > book-env\Scripts\activate

Successful activation will change your shell prompt by adding environment name
prefix:

    (book-env)$

Now you can finally use `pip` to install all packages that are mentioned in
book and used in example scripts:

    (book-env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
